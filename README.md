# TypeRacingGame

For this project, I am interested in creating a type racing game that uses sequence alignment of words in the sentences to estimate performance. \
Iâ€™m using **R** to determine what are the best parameters of $\alpha$ and $\delta$ to determine a match of words in the type racing context, 
and to perform analysis of the algorithm's performance. \
Otherwise, the game is entirely coded in Python and is simply run from the command line.

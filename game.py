Word Typing Game
Inspired by typeracer.com, I want to create a game in python that gives a random sentence from a file and 
expects you to type it out as fast as you can. 
A few things I want to achieve with this game are listed below:
    - Fork a dataset that contains a bunch of different sentences. 
    - Create a text base UI. Y
    - Create a simple typing game that measures time and accuracy of your attempt. Y
    -   - Create a better scoring system to detemine the distances between words that goes beyond sequence alignment.
    -   -   - Allocate a compensation for letters that are capitilised.
    - Upload to GitHub. Y
    - Create a typing game that takes previous scores and uses it to measure progress. 
    -   - This involves saving previous scores.
    - Create a timer window that tracks the time spent on the task.
    - Save
